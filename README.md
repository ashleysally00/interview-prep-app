# Interview Preparation Assistant

I combined the confidence assessment quiz and AI interviewer chatbot into one Streamlit application. You can run and test it locally by cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, installing requirements, and configuring your API keys. All functionality is working as expected. I have not yet deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud as it requires redeployment after each change, so that will be the final step.

## Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Google (Gemini) API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashleysally00/interview-prep-app.git
cd interview-prep-app
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# MacOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your API keys:

Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

Create `.env` in root directory:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

5. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Note

Make sure to never commit your API keys or secrets file to GitHub. The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this, but always double-check before committing changes.
